# UnityandGoogleCardboard
During the Spring of 2018, I will be participating in an Independent Study revolving around the affects of Virtual Reality mobile gaming on visual fatigue. So I decided to fiddle around with some Unity projects and C# scripts. Nothing huge, but still really fun to develop.

There's some of my files that show some of the C# scripting I did and some of the cool Assets that can be manipulated on Unity to make objects wherever and however you want. I was able to learn how to set it all up, create cool objects, move objects using scripting, authenticate with Google's VR SDK and eventually build it to iOS and Android. VR is pretty cool. :)
